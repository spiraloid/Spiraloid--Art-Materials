These are my workshop PBR materials for Clay and Plywood that I use when sculpting in various apps. 

Feel free to use, integrate or modify as you see fit.


notes:
* The textures are tiling and work best with cubemap projection.  
* The hdr is a black and white low res that runs fast as and HDRI IBL on most devices. 
* if you setup everything correctly, it should look like this (assuming you are using ambient occlusion)
